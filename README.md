In addition to the midterm test, we were assigned a small project. This was a GUI program that would take any random string and parse out the 
consonants or vowels. My version was a small window that you enter a string into, then push a button for which you would like to find. When you
are all done you can reset the entry field and results. It wasn't pretty, but it just works.

# test_parse
Often times as a programmer you need to tackle individual problems before you write the entire program. I knew that I needed to parse a simple
string and then display it correctly. This is easier done before adding tkinter (the GUI) into the mix. Once I knew that I could acquire the 
desired result, I then went back and added it in. It is far easier to troubleshoot one problem than multiple problems. Typically with these problems
I just comment out the different attempts, just in case I need to go back.
